BEGUMPET Observatory Weather Forecasting (2010â€“2024) :- 

This project focuses on time series forecasting of average daily temperatures using historical weather data from the BEGUMPET Observatory (Hyderabad, India) covering the years 2010 to 2024.

Dataset:-

Source: BEGUMPET Weather Observatory
Duration: 2010 to 2024
Columns:- Date , Average_Temperature.

Visualized temperature trends over time.Checked for stationarity.

Models Implemented:-
ARIMA , SARIMA , ETS (Exponential Smoothing method) , Random Forest Regressor.

Results:-
ETS performed reasonably well with a MAPE of 14%
Random Forest outperformed traditional methods with a significantly better MAPE of 3.31%.
